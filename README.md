# Medieval Discord Bot

## Playing the game

New guild members will automatically be entered into the game when they join the server.
The RPG bot will DM you to choose a class.

For existing members you can use the `/new-game` command. 
The RPG bot will then DM you to choose a class.

**USING `/new-game` WILL DELETE ALL OF YOUR OLD DATA**

When starting a new game you can choose from the **Knight**, the **Wizard** and the **Archer** classes.

To see all of the commands that are set up for this bot, you can type `/help`.

There are two ways of gaining gold and EXP: being an active member in chat and going on quests with `/quest`.
For quests you'll be able to fight a large variation of enemies, for more information go to the automated help menu in the [discord](https://discord.gg/FqZ6PGbXyR).

As you fight, you might take damage! Be sure to use `/shop` for **üß™ Potions** and **‚öóÔ∏è Ethers** to heal your HP and MP. 
If you get knocked out, you won't be able to do any more quests. You'll need to get your hands on a **ü¶Ä Revival Crab**. 
Once in your possesion you can trigger the `/use-item` command.

If you're feeling generous you can `/give gold` or `/give item` to gift someone in the server.

Happy questing!
